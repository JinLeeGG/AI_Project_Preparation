# Location strategy for a coffee franchise (2025/06/27, 2025/06/30)

## Problem 

Coffee shop IDIYA Coffee once had a strategy of “defend the seat next to Starbucks” - if there were no seats available during “peak hours,” such as lunch, people would naturally go to the IDIYA store next door. They also emphasized their differentiation with low coffee prices - in fact, sales at the Starbucks location were higher than at other locations.

## What will we do?

We will web crawl Starbucks and other coffee franchise locations using Selenium to verify if this is true.
