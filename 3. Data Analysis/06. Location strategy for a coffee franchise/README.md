# Location strategy for a coffee franchise (2025/06/27~)

## Problem 

Coffee shop IDIYA Coffee once had a strategy of “defend the seat next to Starbucks” - if there were no seats available during “peak hours,” such as lunch, people would naturally go to the IDIYA store next door. They also emphasized their differentiation with low coffee prices - in fact, sales at the Starbucks location were higher than at other locations.

## What we will do?

We will webcrawl starbuck and IDIYA Coffee shop locations using Selenium and Folium to actually see if this is true.
